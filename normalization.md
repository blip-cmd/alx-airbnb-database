# Database Normalization for Airbnb-like System

## Overview
This document explains the normalization process applied to the Airbnb database design to achieve Third Normal Form (3NF), ensuring data integrity, reducing redundancy, and optimizing storage efficiency.

## Normalization Principles Applied

### First Normal Form (1NF)
**Definition**: Each table cell contains only atomic (indivisible) values, and each record is unique.

**Applied to our design**:
- ✅ All attributes contain atomic values (no multi-valued attributes)
- ✅ Each table has a primary key ensuring record uniqueness
- ✅ No repeating groups or arrays within columns

**Examples**:
- User's `name` is split into `first_name` and `last_name` (atomic values)
- Property `location` stores a single location string (not multiple addresses)
- Message `message_body` contains a single text value

### Second Normal Form (2NF)
**Definition**: Must be in 1NF and all non-key attributes must be fully functionally dependent on the primary key.

**Applied to our design**:
- ✅ All tables use simple primary keys (UUIDs), avoiding partial dependencies
- ✅ No composite primary keys that could create partial dependencies
- ✅ All non-key attributes depend entirely on their table's primary key

**Analysis by table**:

1. **User Table**: All attributes (`first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, etc.) fully depend on `user_id`
2. **Property Table**: All attributes (`name`, `description`, `location`, etc.) fully depend on `property_id`
3. **Booking Table**: All attributes (`start_date`, `end_date`, `total_price`, etc.) fully depend on `booking_id`
4. **Payment Table**: All attributes (`amount`, `payment_date`, `payment_method`) fully depend on `payment_id`
5. **Review Table**: All attributes (`rating`, `comment`, `created_at`) fully depend on `review_id`
6. **Message Table**: All attributes (`message_body`, `sent_at`) fully depend on `message_id`

### Third Normal Form (3NF)
**Definition**: Must be in 2NF and no transitive dependencies exist (non-key attributes should not depend on other non-key attributes).

**Applied to our design**:
- ✅ All non-key attributes depend directly on the primary key
- ✅ No transitive dependencies identified
- ✅ Related data is properly separated into different tables

**Potential Issues Identified and Resolved**:

1. **Original Issue**: Property location could contain city, state, country as one field
   - **Solution**: Kept as single location field for simplicity, but could be normalized further if needed
   - **Alternative**: Create separate Location table with city_id, state_id, country_id

2. **Original Issue**: User role could imply additional attributes
   - **Solution**: Role is kept as simple ENUM, additional role-specific data would go in separate tables

## Normalization Steps Taken

### Step 1: Identify Entities and Attributes
- Separated distinct entities: User, Property, Booking, Payment, Review, Message
- Ensured each entity has a clear, single responsibility

### Step 2: Eliminate Multi-valued Dependencies
- **Before**: User could have multiple contact methods in one field
- **After**: Separated into distinct fields (email, phone_number)

### Step 3: Remove Partial Dependencies
- Used simple UUID primary keys throughout
- Avoided composite keys that could create partial dependencies

### Step 4: Eliminate Transitive Dependencies
- **Example**: In Booking table, we could have derived `host_id` from `property_id`
- **Solution**: Access host information through proper joins rather than storing redundant data

### Step 5: Establish Proper Relationships
- Created appropriate foreign key relationships
- Ensured referential integrity through proper constraints

## Detailed Table Analysis

### User Table - Normalized Structure
```sql
User (
    user_id,        -- Primary Key
    first_name,     -- Depends on user_id
    last_name,      -- Depends on user_id
    email,          -- Depends on user_id
    password_hash,  -- Depends on user_id
    phone_number,   -- Depends on user_id
    role,           -- Depends on user_id
    created_at      -- Depends on user_id
)
```
**3NF Compliance**: ✅ All attributes directly depend on user_id

### Property Table - Normalized Structure
```sql
Property (
    property_id,    -- Primary Key
    host_id,        -- Foreign Key to User
    name,           -- Depends on property_id
    description,    -- Depends on property_id
    location,       -- Depends on property_id
    price_per_night,-- Depends on property_id
    created_at,     -- Depends on property_id
    updated_at      -- Depends on property_id
)
```
**3NF Compliance**: ✅ All attributes directly depend on property_id

### Booking Table - Normalized Structure
```sql
Booking (
    booking_id,     -- Primary Key
    property_id,    -- Foreign Key to Property
    user_id,        -- Foreign Key to User
    start_date,     -- Depends on booking_id
    end_date,       -- Depends on booking_id
    total_price,    -- Depends on booking_id
    status,         -- Depends on booking_id
    created_at      -- Depends on booking_id
)
```
**3NF Compliance**: ✅ All attributes directly depend on booking_id

### Payment Table - Normalized Structure
```sql
Payment (
    payment_id,     -- Primary Key
    booking_id,     -- Foreign Key to Booking
    amount,         -- Depends on payment_id
    payment_date,   -- Depends on payment_id
    payment_method  -- Depends on payment_id
)
```
**3NF Compliance**: ✅ All attributes directly depend on payment_id

### Review Table - Normalized Structure
```sql
Review (
    review_id,      -- Primary Key
    property_id,    -- Foreign Key to Property
    user_id,        -- Foreign Key to User
    rating,         -- Depends on review_id
    comment,        -- Depends on review_id
    created_at      -- Depends on review_id
)
```
**3NF Compliance**: ✅ All attributes directly depend on review_id

### Message Table - Normalized Structure
```sql
Message (
    message_id,     -- Primary Key
    sender_id,      -- Foreign Key to User
    recipient_id,   -- Foreign Key to User
    message_body,   -- Depends on message_id
    sent_at         -- Depends on message_id
)
```
**3NF Compliance**: ✅ All attributes directly depend on message_id

## Additional Normalization Considerations

### Beyond 3NF (Optional Improvements)

1. **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**
   - Current design already meets BCNF requirements
   - No functional dependencies where determinant is not a candidate key

2. **Fourth Normal Form (4NF)**
   - No multi-valued dependencies present in current design
   - Each table represents a single concept

### Potential Further Normalization

1. **Location Normalization**
   ```sql
   -- Could create separate tables for:
   Country (country_id, country_name)
   State (state_id, state_name, country_id)
   City (city_id, city_name, state_id)
   Property (property_id, ..., city_id)
   ```

2. **User Role Normalization**
   ```sql
   -- Could create:
   Role (role_id, role_name, permissions)
   User (user_id, ..., role_id)
   ```

## Benefits of Current Normalization

1. **Data Integrity**: Eliminates inconsistencies and anomalies
2. **Storage Efficiency**: Reduces redundant data storage
3. **Update Anomalies**: Prevents inconsistent updates
4. **Insert Anomalies**: Allows independent data insertion
5. **Delete Anomalies**: Prevents unintended data loss

## Validation Checklist
